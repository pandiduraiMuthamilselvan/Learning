Inheritance:
---------------
we can access one class property into another class by using extend keywords.

Advantage of inheritance:
-------------------------------
1)reusable code purpose
2)memory waste is low

Types of Inheritance:
--------------------------
1)single Inheritance
2)Multiple Inheritance
3)Multilevel Inheritance
4)Hierarchal Inheritance
5)Hybrid Inheritance

Singe Inheritance:
-----------------------
combination of one parent class and one child class

Multiple Inheritance:
--------------------------
more than one parent class accessing the child class paralley at a time.

Multilevel Inheritance:
----------------------------
more than one parent class accessing the child class in tree level structure.

Hierarchal Inheritance:
-----------------------------
combination of one parent class and more than one child class.

Hybrid Inheritance:
------------------------
//combination of single and multiple inheritance.//
combination of hierarchal and multilevel inheritance.


syntax
--------
Access specifier       child class        extends       parent class
(public or private)    (sub class)    (keyword)         (super class)


Multiple Inheritance
--------------------------
can't work in java by using extends keyword due to syntax error and priority problem.
syntax error
---------------
we should not use comma after extends,
priority problem
--------------------
compiler will get confused to call which method is first

to overcome multiple inheritance by using interface concepts


childclass->access the property
parentclass->getting the property
