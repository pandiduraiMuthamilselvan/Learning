
Encapsulation
---------------------
Encapsulation in Java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit,
 for example, a capsule which is mixed of several medicines.

We can create a fully encapsulated class in Java by making all the data members of the class private. 
Now we can use setter and getter methods to set and get the data in it.


Ways to achieve Encapsulation in Java
There are a few ways by which we can achieve encapsulation in java. Some of them are:

a. Declaring the class variables as private so that they are inaccessible from outside 
the scope of the class.
b. Designing getter and setter methods for the class and using them accordingly. 
The presence of getter and setter methods in a class define what type of class it is.
